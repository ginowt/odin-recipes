 <h1>Pasta aglio olio e peperoncino</h1>   
 <img src="../images/pastaaop.jpg" Alt = "Pasta aglio olio e peperoncino" >
<h5>This late-night Roman staple is astonishingly full-flavored. Start the water before you do anything else, because the sauce takes less than 10 minutes start to finish.</h5>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>¾  pound linguine or spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 to 3  whole fresh peperoncini (small red chiles), or small dried red chiles </li>
    <li>⅔  cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>4  garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>¼  cup chopped Italian parsley </li>
    <!--In this way I created an unorder list in order to show the ingredients-->

</ul>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Put a pot of salted water on to boil. Remove the stems of the peperoncini, halve them lengthwise, then slice them into 1/4-inch lengths. Put the oil, garlic and peperoncini in a large deep pan set over medium-high heat, and cook until the garlic is translucent and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the parsley to the pan, and turn off the heat.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta until it is aldente, nearly but not quite done and still a bit chalky in the middle. Drain, and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid.</li>
<p></p>
<li>When the oil has cooled for a couple of minutes, add 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, and reduce over high heat by about half. Add the pasta, and stir vigorously as it continues to cook. Add the reserved pasta water a bit at a time as necessary to finish cooking the pasta, and develop the thickened sauce. Season with salt, and serve.</li>
